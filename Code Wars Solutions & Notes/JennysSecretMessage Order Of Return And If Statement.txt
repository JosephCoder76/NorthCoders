Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user. However, she's in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him slightly different. She added a special case to her function, but she made a mistake.

function greet(name){
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
  if(name === "Johnny")
    return "Hello, my love!";
}

The issue here is that a return statement will always terminate a function so the first return ends the function, so the if statement never runs.
Solution put the if statement above the first return statement as per below:-

function greet(name){
  
  if(name === "Johnny")
  return "Hello, my love!"; 
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
 
}
