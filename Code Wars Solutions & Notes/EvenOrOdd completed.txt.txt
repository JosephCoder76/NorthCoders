//Modulo Operator % divides a number and and returns value, if 0 fully divisable by 2 so an even number else and odd number.
//Note that this also works for negative number not just positive integers
//So we pass 2,0,7, and 1 from the sample tests no need to add to the code blocl the function calls.
//If the number is divisable by 2(Modulo operator) with an explicit remainder of 0 so it must return the integer value and not a string, return the string 'Even'
//the function then terminates as the Even condition is met, we can then add the return 'Odd'; statement as this sits outside of the function
//and therefore picks up the odd numbers or the false conditions, neat way of not needing to code in an else statement.

Example 2
/The below is a shortcut was of doing an if statement the ? instructs if %2 does not fully divide by 2 return "Odd" else "Even".
   return number % 2 ? "Odd" : "Even"
