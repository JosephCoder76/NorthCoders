function sumArray(array) {
  //check if array is null
  //initial sum variable
  //sort the array
  //remove highest and lowest
  //sum the numbers
  //return sum
  
  //if statement to exit the function if the value of the array is null
  if (array === null) return 0;
  //else decalre a variable for sum
  let sum = 0;
  //now we sort the array using the compare function so we get the numbers in ascending order
  // 1,2,6,8,10
  array.sort(function(a,b){
  // a -b retuns increasing list of numbers from the sorted array 1,2,6,8,10
    //a < b returns highest to lowest numbers in the array 10,8,6,2,1
    return a -b;
   });
    
  //so now the array numbers are sorted in to ascending order we want to remove the first and last element
  //the lowest and hishest numbers
  let newArray = array.slice(1,-1);
  //console.log(newArray)
  //now sum the numbers of the array as we have now removed the highest and lowest numbers from the array using
  //the splice function, sum now equals the value of each array element of the newArray that we iterate through
  for (i=0; i < newArray.length; i++) sum += newArray[i];
    //console.log(sum)
  return sum;

function sumArray(array) {
	let sum = 0;
	if (array === null) return 0;
	array.sort(function(a,b){
	return a -b;
 	});
	let newArray = array.slice(1,-1);
	for (i=0; i < newArray.length; i++) sum += newArray[i];
	return sum;
	}
    
Another way would be to use a for loop after the sort and compare function array.sort(function(a,b)
because we have sorted the array in to ascending order starting with the lowest and ending with the highest number
we know that the first index of the array 0 will have the lowest value and the last index of the array will have the highest number
thus we instruct the for loop to start at index one thus removing element 0 the lowest number and finish the loop -1 one element less than the last element of the array.length function call, then just add each of the elements from the iteration to sum to get the total
for (var i =1; i < array.length -1; i++)
  sum += sum(i)
