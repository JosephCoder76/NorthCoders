Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.

For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

function squareSum(numbers){
//so first of all we need to multiply the numbers passesd to the function by themselves
//then we need to add the result of each of the multiplications together for example [1,2]) = 5)
//use a For loop to iterate through the array one element at a time so we can do the multiplication of the element on its square
//then pass the result to a total variable 
//initiate a total variable  
  let total = 0;
  //for loop iterates until i is not less than the array length
  for (i=0; i<numbers.length; i++){
    //total = itself + the numbers element for the current itteration, * by itself, this becomes a running total until
    //the for loop exits and then the return statement returns the total variable value
    total = total + numbers[i]*numbers[i]
     
    
  }
    return total;
}

function squareSum(numbers){
  let total = 0;
  for (i=0; i<numbers.length; i++){
  total = total + numbers[i]*numbers[i]
        
  }
    return total;
}
