function createArray(number){
  var newArray = [];
//The For loop needs to itterate and add a value to the counter variable otherwise the exit condition counter <= number will never execute, thus an infinite loop
  for(var counter = 1; counter <= number;){
    newArray.push(counter);
  }
  
  return newArray;
}

Solution

function createArray(number){
  var newArray = [];
  //it looks lie the iteration termination statement is the problem, set this to the length of the array
  for(var counter = 1; counter <= number; counter++){
    newArray.push(counter);
  }
  
  return newArray;
}
