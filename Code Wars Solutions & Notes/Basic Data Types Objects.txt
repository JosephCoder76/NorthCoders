In javascript, Object is one of basic data types. Define an Object can use var obj=new Object() or var obj={}

You can define the object attributes during initialization, like this:

var animal={name:"dog"}
you can also set/get some properties after the object definition, like this:

var animal={}
animal.name="dog"  (or animal["name"]="dog")
Task
Give you a function animal, accept 1 parameter:obj like this:

{name:"dog",legs:4,color:"white"}
and return a string like this:

"This white dog has 4 legs."

function animal(obj){
  //return the properties required to build the string "This white do has 4 legs"
  //use an object get method to retrieve the required properties and assign them to a variable we will assign to the return
  //statement, we concantenate strings with the values of object key values we call using the obj call with .notation that 
  // that call the value of each of the keys such as color name legs etc..
  let output = "This " + obj.color + " "+ obj.name + " has " + obj.legs + " legs." 
  //console.log(output)
  return (output)
}
