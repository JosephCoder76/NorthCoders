function luckyCandies(prizes, k) {
  //candies must be multiples of k condition
  //Return maximum amount of candies JOhn can get
  //console.log()
  //Incorrect answer for prizes = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 5: expected undefined to equal 15
  //So we know that the output should = 15
  //Each element is a bag of candies
  //Whole bag only do full integers returned only
  //Sum all the array elements through a for loop and find the largest multiple of K from the sum of the elements
  //Lets get the first test working first to return 15 a multiple of 5
 
  //So the below worked and got us started, now I realize we have to find the the largest multiple of k available in the 
  //sum of the array, so we need a For Loop that will sum all the elements, that we can do already. Then we now need
  //a comparison to compare the result and if it does not return a full integer it keeps on looping until a multiple os found
  //Thinkg of a for loop with modulos as the exit condition when it returns 0 from the sum.
  // let sum=0;
  
 // for (let i=0; i<prizes.length; i++){
 //   sum = sum + prizes[i];
  
//  }
//console.log(sum)
  let sum = 0;
  
  let maxCandies =0;
  
  //Sum all the elements in the array
  for (let i=0; i<prizes.length; i++){
   sum = sum + prizes[i];

  //If the division of the sum is a full integer and this returns 0 we have found the largest multiple  
  if (sum %===0){
    maxCandies = sum;
    }
  //We need to get rid of one element of the array at a time until the condition is met  
  else {
