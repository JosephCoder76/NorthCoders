  //Each element is a bag of candies

  //Sum all the array elements through a for loop and find the largest multiple of K from the sum of the elements
  //Lets get the first test working first to return 15 a multiple of 5
 
  //So the below worked and got us started, now I realize we have to find the the largest multiple of k available in the 
  //sum of the array, so we need a For Loop that will sum all the elements, that we can do already. Then we now need
  //a comparison to compare the result and if it does not return a full integer it keeps on looping until a multiple os found
  //Thinkg of a for loop with modulos as the exit condition when it returns 0 from the sum.
  // let sum=0;
  
 // for (let i=0; i<prizes.length; i++){
 //   sum = sum + prizes[i];
