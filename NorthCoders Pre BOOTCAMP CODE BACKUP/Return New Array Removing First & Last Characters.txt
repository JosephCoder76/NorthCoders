/*Solution 2
  Create a new array containing only the first an last items of the array
  Return the newArray and make it equal the return values of both splices concatenated with the ,
  character.
  The first splice starts at position zero of the array and the second paramter removes
  this character found at position zero, and the second splice deals with removing the last character
  using -1 and removes 1 character using the second parameter. So the first parameter in the splice
  is the starting position and the second aparamter instructs the interpreter on how many charcters to remove
  We dont need to decalre newArray as an array as the splice method returns an array so this type is assigned
  by proxy
